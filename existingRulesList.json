Microsoft Defender ATP also contains behavioral detections for defending against this threat.\nThe following query locates Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 machines initiating outbound connections to internal or public IP addresses on TCP port 3389. It filters out common RDP programs and scanning tools and shows the number of connections per machine.

    "Description": "This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Exploitation of CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep).\nCVE-2019-0708, also known as BlueKeep, is a critical remote code execution vulnerability involving RDP. Soon after its disclosure, the NSA issued a rare advisory about this vulnerability, out of concern that it could be used to quickly spread malware. Attackers have since used this vulnerability to install cryptocurrency miners on targets.\nMicrosoft has issued updates for this vulnerability, as well as guidance for protecting operating systems that we no longer support. Microsoft Defender ATP also contains behavioral detections for defending against this threat.\nThe following query locates devices that have communicated with attacker infrastructure associated with BlueKeep-related cryptomining.\nReferences:\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0708\nhttps://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/News-Stories/Article-View/Article/1865726/nsa-cybersecurity-advisory-patch-remote-desktop-services-on-legacy-versions-of/\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/bluekeep-hacking-cryptocurrency-mining/\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/help/4500705/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/11/07/the-new-cve-2019-0708-rdp-exploit-attacks-explained/\n",

Exploits for CVE-2018-15982 have also been included in several exploit kits.\nIn some initial attacks exploiting CVE-2018-15982, attackers sent targets spear-phishing emails.

Opening the document would automatically run an embedded Flash ActiveX control. This, in turn, would call a script containing the exploit.

The payload is a backdoor used both to achieve persistance and for command and control.\nThe following query detects possible instances of a payload being extracted by the exploit.\nReferences:\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15982\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb18-42.html\n",
